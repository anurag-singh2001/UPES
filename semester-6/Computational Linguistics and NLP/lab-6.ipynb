Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. When replacing `np.int`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.\nThe aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at:\n    https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations"
