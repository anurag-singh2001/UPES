Java ArrayList Class
    The ArrayList class of the Java collections' framework provides the
    functionality of resizable-arrays.
    It implements the List interface.


Java ArrayList Vs Array
    In Java, we need to declare the size of an array before we can use it.
    Once the size of an array is declared, it's hard to change it.
    To handle this issue, we can use the ArrayList class. It allows us to create resizable arrays.
    Unlike arrays, arraylists can automatically adjust its capacity
    when we add or remove elements from it.
    Hence, arraylists are also known as dynamic arrays.

Basic Operations on ArrayList
    The ArrayList class provides various methods to perform different operations on arraylists.
        Add elements
        Access elements
        Change elements
        Remove elements

Methods of ArrayList Class
    size() =>	Returns the length of the arraylist.
    sort() => Sort the arraylist elements.
    clone() =>	Creates a new arraylist with the same element, size, and capacity.
    contains() => Searches the arraylist for the specified element and returns a boolean result.
    ensureCapacity() => Specifies the total element the arraylist can contain.
    isEmpty() => Checks if the arraylist is empty.
    indexOf() => Searches a specified element in an arraylist and returns the index of the element.

Iterate through an ArrayList
We can use the Java for-each loop to loop through each element of the arraylist.
