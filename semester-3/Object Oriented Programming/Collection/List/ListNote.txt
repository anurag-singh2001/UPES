Classes that Implement List
    Since List is an interface, we cannot create objects from it.
    In order to use functionalities of the List interface,
    we can use these classes:
       * ArrayList
       * LinkedList
       * Vector
       * Stack

Methods of List
    The List interface includes all the methods of the Collection interface.
    Its because Collection is a super interface of List.

Some commonly used methods of the Collection interface
that's also available in the List interface are:

    add() - adds an element to a list
    addAll() - adds all elements of one list to another
    get() - helps to randomly access elements from lists
    iterator() - returns iterator object that can be used to sequentially access elements of lists
    set() - changes elements of lists
    remove() - removes an element from the list
    removeAll() - removes all the elements from the list
    clear() - removes all the elements from the list (more efficient than removeAll())
    size() - returns the length of lists
    toArray() - converts a list into an array
    contains() - returns true if a list contains specified element
